# Arithmetic and Logical Unit Design Project

I am thrilled to announce that our team, under the guidance of our course coordinator [Name], has successfully completed the Arithmetic and Logical Unit Design Project as a part of our Digital Circuits course, ECE 212!

## Project Overview

As a team, we designed an ALU using Verilog, a hardware description language, to perform arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU supports 16 operations, including increment/decrement, multiplication, addition, complementing, and various logical operations. We also incorporated bonus features such as signed input and output, fastest and most efficient architectures, layout of custom-digital implementation, and FPGA implementation of semi-custom implementation.

Throughout the project, we explored various architectures such as complementary CMOS, ratioed logic, DCVSL, pass-transistor logic, and dynamic logic, and evaluated their performance in terms of delay and power consumption. We also designed the transistor-level/block-diagram schematics of the ALU using Cadence and performed circuit-level simulations to ensure proper functioning of the ALU.

Under the expert guidance of our course coordinator, we gained a deep understanding of digital circuits, hardware description languages, simulation tools, and various digital circuit design techniques, including the implementation of custom-digital and semi-custom architectures.
